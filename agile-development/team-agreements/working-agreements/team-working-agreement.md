# Team Working Agreement

The team working agreement is an optional document, intended to be used at a crew level. It should include topics in regards to creating a culture that the team wants to foster.

While this document is recommended to be used across engagements for the crew as a whole, we also recommend using your decisions in your team agreement as a starting point for additional sections in the Engagement Working Agreement.

To create a successful team working agreement, you will want to take into account the different personalities and diverse perspectives on your team. For example, through training such as Insights, followed up with team reviews and sharing about how each person likes to work. This document outlines some examples for topics to tackle together.

## Meetings

For meetings, some recommendations are below, as a starting point to review with your team and decide which ideas you like, what you might tweak, and what you could add:

- Every meeting should have an agenda and goals in the meeting body
- Every meeting should make use of Required and Optional
- Meetings should include links to documents being used, or any prior research that will be neeed
- Meetings should be held in a specific Teams channel
- Meetings should be sent out at least 2 days before they would occur, unless exceptional circumstances
- The team's distribution list should be used to mark attendees of a meeting
- All required meetings must fall within the Good Times window the team has chosen, and optional meetings should when possible.
- No meetings should be scheduled during the agreed-upon No Meeting Day/Window
- Meetings are 25 or 50 minutes, not 30 or 60

### Choosing Good Times

Pick a window that's a good spot daily for every team member. This is crucial because CSE is a global team, and it can be even more impactful if you ask every individual member for their preferences so as not to assume that everybody's day is at a desk 9-5 as we have many folks working at home offices, or at shifted hours.

## Culture

- When you're not sure, ask
- Use the [10 Inclusive Culture Tips guide](TODO find the guide)
- Give constructive feedback privately
- Async communications via Teams are preferred over meetings (or vice versa)
- Keep sharing feedback with each other
- Prefer learning something new over choosing tasks you've already done before (or vice versa)
