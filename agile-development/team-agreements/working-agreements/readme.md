# Working Agreements

There are two kinds of working agreements that we work with in CSE. Firstly, each crew may choose to create a [Team Working Agreement](team-working-agreement.md) to guide how they work together as a crew. Secondly, at the start of each new engagement, the crew should work with all parties both internal and external on developing and agreeing to an [Engagement Working Agreement](engagement-working-agreement.md).
